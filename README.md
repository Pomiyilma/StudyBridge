                                                        StudyBridge
StudyBridge is an intelligent learning platform designed to connect academic topics across subjects and guide Ethiopian Highschool students 
in topic-connection exploration by helping them have a deep understanding in one smooth flow. It relies on accurate topic connection through 
cognitive computing that we built rather than manual database full of connected topics. This feature alone 100% ensures this project's extensive 
scalability for future use.

The platform combines:
Secure email-verified authentication (OTP-based),                                                                          
A React-powered interactive frontend,
A cloud-based database as a backend connected to MongoDB Atlas.

Topic linking using trusted sources such as YouTube videos, Wikipedia explanations, and published books

                                                       What We Built: 
- Authentication System
OTP-based email verification for first-time registration
Secure password creation after OTP verification
Password-based login (OTP not required after first verification)
OTP-based password reset
JWT authentication for protected routes

- StudyBridge Core Platform
React frontend for topic analysis and learning flow
Backend services for topic storage, linking, and retrieval
Uses trusted learning sources: YouTube videos, Published books, Wikipedia descriptions.

                                                   How to Run the Project
- Start the Backend
Navigate to: STUDYbridgee/backend
Run: npm install
     npm start
You should see: OPENAI_API_KEY: FOUND ✅  
                🚀 Server running on port 5000  
                Auth DB connected ✅ 
                Main DB connected ✅

- Start the React Frontend
Navigate to: STUDYbridgee/studybridge-frontend
Run: npm install
     npm start
The React app runs on: http://localhost:3000

                                                    Important Runtime Notes:
If redirection does not happen immediately after registration or login: Try restarting the React app (This can occur due to React state caching \
during auth token updates, but Backend authentication will still be correct.)

Email & OTP System: OTPs and system emails are sent using a team member’s email account.

Learning Sources Used: StudyBridge links and explanations may include: Curated YouTube educational 
videos, Published academic and reference books, Wikipedia summaries for foundational understanding. 
These sources are combined to create bridges between topics, not just isolated explanations.
